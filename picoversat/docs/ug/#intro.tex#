\section{Introduction}

A single full-adder has two one-bit inputs, sum output. Many of them can be used together to create a ripple carry adder which can be used to add large numbers together. A single full-adder is shown in the picture belowPicoVersat is a minimal hardware controller. It is designed for simple control
tasks where normally finite state machines are employed. Being a programmable
solution, the risk of hardware design errors is mitigated and the design of
complex control structures is simplified.

%PicoVersat features a minimal instruction set which is not designed for high
%performance computing. However, it can effectively implement simple algorithms
%and perform simple calculations. PicoVersat has a program memory interface and a memory mapped data interface.
