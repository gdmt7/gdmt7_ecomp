\section{Block Diagram}

The project block diagram is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bd}.The latest version of the project is for the entire system to work with the PS / 2 interface, using a keyboard to enter the game keys according to the correct sequence. But first, we will try to implement the game algorithm with the switch interface, because it's easier for us if the project flow goes wrong, we have something to demonstrate in the final project delivery.
