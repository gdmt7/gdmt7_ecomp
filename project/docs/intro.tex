\section{Introduction}

This proposal is to present the work to be done at the Computer Electronic Systems (SEC) course of the Master's degree in Electronic Engineering (MEE), the main objective is to development the memory game, to be performed on Field-Programmable Gate Array device (FPGA).

\noindent
The project will be developed using a hardware description language (verilog), following the structural logic description model, and the control part of the system will be implemented using assembly languague of the PicoVersat processor.
